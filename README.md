# SQL Aggregate Functions Project  

## Overview  
This project showcases the use of SQL aggregate functions to analyze sales data. It includes:  
- Table creation for storing sales records.  
- Data insertion to simulate real-world scenarios.  
- Aggregate queries to extract insights like total sales, average quantities, and extreme values.  

## Features  
- **Table Structure**: A comprehensive schema for sales data.  
- **Aggregate Functions Used**: `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `COUNT()`, `MAX()`, `MIN()`.  
- **Queries**: Detailed SQL scripts for analysis.

## SQL Aggregate Functions Used  
- `SUM()`: Calculates the total of all values in a column.  
- `AVG()`: Finds the average of values.  
- `COUNT()`: Counts the number of rows matching a condition.  
- `MAX()`: Identifies the highest value.  
- `MIN()`: Identifies the lowest value. 

## Files  
- SQL Script for creating, inserting and performing data analysis with aggregate functions on sales table.    
- Screenshots: Visual examples of table creation, data insertion, and query results.  

## How to Use  
1. Run the scripts in the `sql` folder in your SQL environment.  
2. Refer to screenshots for expected results.
